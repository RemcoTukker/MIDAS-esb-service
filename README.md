MIDAS-esb-service
=================

A JBoss ESB service that uses ZeroMQ to communicate with the MIDAS agent system (which is run on NodeJS).

This service will be the gateway for any interaction between MIDAS and the other ARUM services. At the moment, this repo only contains the skeleton of the service, functionality still has to be implemented.

This service may have to be revised for TSB integration.
